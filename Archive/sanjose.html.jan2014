jazz jam with plenty of music majors, thanks to close proximity to
SJSU. Send a review and let us know what books they're reading (if
any!) .<br><br>I
hit the Hedley Lounge&nbsp;last night and was impressed by the energy
and diversity of the players....@13 yrs old all the way up to seniors,
amateur to pro, and the lounge has a cool ceiling too...but maybe it
was the vodka talking! ;&gt;) Oscar Pangilinan, sax, was a gracious
host. He and the band blew the roof off a couple John Ellis tunes.

When I'm in the South Bay on Friday nights, I try to catch the jam
(10.00pm) at Woodham's in Santa Clara. Some great guitar players hang
out there, and occasionally there are some good horn players. (Updated

This
is a blues-rock Jam night and a legendary place for guitar-slingers to show their stuff, although not so much for
horns. Zoo-like atmosphere at times and rock-n-roll is always available
on the menu. Send a review! <br><br><br><h2>Murphy's Law, Sunnyvale</h2>When: Monday evenings Blues Jam (NOT Sundays as shown in their calendar)<br><br>Where: <a href="http://murphyslawpub.com">Murphy's Law</a>, 135 South Murphy Ave. , Sunnyvale &nbsp;408.736.3822 &nbsp;<a href="http://murphyslawpub.com/calendar.html">Calendar</a><br><br>Host: Mike Phillips<br><br><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">There
is a five year old Monday jam that Mike Phillips hosts (see Neto's jam
above). Dennis Dove plays drums every other week, when he's not at the
Fog Bank in Capitola, and June Core (Charlie Musselwhite's drummer) is
often there on the off weeks. Johnny Cat (Terry Hanck's guitar player)
is the regular guitar player if he's in town. When Mike is on the road
with Charlie, he asks someone else to run the jam - Dennis often does
it, but there are a number of other subs also. (Updated Feb 2011 by SE)</span><br><br><br><h2>Grand Dell Saloon, Campbell</h2>When: Thursday evenings Pro Blues Jam 8-11pm<br><br>Where: <a href="http://thegranddell.com">Grand Dell Saloo</a>n, 1040 Dell Ave., Campbell &nbsp;408.378.3970 &nbsp;<a href="http://thegranddell.com/music.html">Calendar<br></a><br>Host: Aki Kumar<br><br><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The
Grand Dell Saloon jam on Thursdays is great. Aki Kumar is an advanced
harp (harmonica) player, a warm human being, and makes people feel
welcome. The jam is not limited to pro level musicians, but they keep
the quality high by giving preference to professional friends, and to
intermediate level players who take their instruments seriously. Other
members of the Tip of the Top band, such as Frank DeRose (bass) and
Carlos Velasco (drums) usually help host the jam. Johnny Cat and Kid
Andersen often fill the guitar position. (Updated Feb 2011 by SE)</span><br><br><br><h2>Blue Rock Shoot, Saratoga</h2>When: Sunday afternoon 3-6pm jazz session<br><br>Where: <a href="http://bluerockshoot.erprod.com/">Blue Rock Shoot</a> cafe, 14523 Big Basin Way, Saratoga &nbsp;408.872.0309<br><br>Long
running jazz session, leans towards straight-ahead and often populated
with local jazz students, enthusiastic adults and suchlike. Parking can
be tricky - drive towards Wildwood Park, where the actual fountain is.
(thanks Yelp)<br><br>Blue Rock Shoot Jam in Saratoga is now starting at 3:00 and I believe, continues to run until 6:00 PM. Check out <a href="http://www.facebook.com/JazzJamSaratoga">their Facebook page</a>
for up to date info. They are in need of sponsors, and only get
donations at this point. House band changes. Parking is actually easy
if you continue to 4th St intersection (very close to the BRS) and turn
left onto 4th ST. There's a free lot there if you look for it, on the
right (not the restaurant though.) (Updated Oct 2012 by DA)<br><br><br><h2>The Pocket, Santa Cruz</h2>When: Thursdays blues jam, 7-10pm<br><br>Where: The Pocket aka "Joes Front Pocket", 3102 Portola Dr, SC &nbsp;831.475.9819<br><br>Host: Varies<br><br>A
