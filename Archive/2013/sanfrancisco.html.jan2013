<h2>Bayview Boat Club</h2>
When: Third Thursday monthly&nbsp;blues jam<br>
<br>
Where: <a href="http://bayviewboatclub.org/events.html">The
Bayview Boat Club</a>
, 489 Terry Francois Blvd., SF - 415.495.9500<br>
<br>
Host: Mike Dingle<br>
<br>
Acoustic players start at around 9, then around 10 or so, things start
to get electric. Jammers should sign in as guests of Mike at the door.
This is one of the quirkiest venues in San Francisco. Don't miss this
one!! (Updated June 2009 by RD)<br>
<br>
I've been to this jam a few times and I can vouch that it is *very*
horn-friendly ! (Updated Oct 2009 by SJ)<br><br>Jam is still going. Awesome players continue to materialize. (Updated Aug 2011 by RD)<br><br>
<h2>Velma's</h2>
When: Monday blues jam<br>
<br>
Where: Velma's, 2246 Jerrold Avenue, SF&nbsp; 415.824.7646
<br>
<br>Velmas has shuttered. SF looking grim these days. (Updated Aug 2011 by RD)<br>
<br>
<h2>Skip's Tavern</h2>
<p> When: Various nights, depending on genre</p>
<p>Where: <a href="http://skipstavern.com">Skip's
Tavern,</a> 458 Cortland Ave, SF 415.282.3456</p>
This jam died when Skips changed owners and became something else. I
stopped by recently. Skip's reopened but old-timers should brace
themselves for a shock. The "new" Skip's contains absolutely no traces
whatsoever of the old one. All pics - memorabilia - memories gone, and
only the horseshoe bar and pool table remain. Chilling is the best
description I can think of (with barren and soulless the runners-up).
The updated format will thoroughly appeal to the hipsters and yuppies
and sundry that have discovered Bernal in recent years. The new owner
has applied for an entertainment permit, but based on what I saw, I do
not expect the electric jam to ever return.&nbsp; (Updated July 2011 by SJ)<br><br>"Lucky
Horseshoe" (new name) got their entertainment permit, but i'm not
holding my breath for any electric sessions. (Updated Mar 2012 by SJ)<br><br>
<h2>Grant and Green</h2>
When: Monday nights pro jazz session<br>
<br>
Where: Grant and Green, 1371 Grant Ave, SF &nbsp;415.693.9565<br>
<br>
Host: Mike Olmos<br>
<br>This jam is discontinued.&nbsp; (Updated Mar 2012 by JB)<br><br>The jam has been moved to Union Room (see below) (updated Mar 2012 by MO)<br><br><br><h2>Union Room<br></h2>When: Monday nights pro jazz session &nbsp;7:30-11:30pm<br><br>Where: <a href="http://www.theunionroom.com/">Union Room</a>, 401 Mason St, SF &nbsp;<span class="skype_pnh_textarea_span"><span class="skype_pnh_text_span">415.292.2583</span></span><span class="skype_pnh_right_span">&nbsp;</span><br><br>Host: Mike Olmos<br><br>Starting
Monday March 19 the jam will be @ the Union Room (upstairs from
Biscuits and Blues) on Mason @ Geary. Music begins @ 730 and ends
around 1130. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Web site says there is a $10 cover charge</span> for this venue - please send a review and let us know if that applies to jammers too.<br><br><h2>50 Mason Social House&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>When: Sunday evenings jazz session 7-10pm<br><br>Where: <a href="http://50masonsocialhouse.com">50 Mason Social House</a>, 50 Mason St, SF&nbsp;(@ Eddy St) &nbsp;<span class="skype_pnh_textarea_span"><span class="skype_pnh_text_span">415.433.5050</span></span><span class="skype_pnh_right_span"></span><br><br>Host: ??<br><br>Former
host Peter Eden passed away late 2011. We're not clear who the new host
is, but the session appears to be still going. The JazzJamSF web page
no longer works, but you can check out the wall on their <a href="http://www.facebook.com/JazzJamAndDanceSF">facebook page here .</a><br><br><br>Stopped
by recently as an observer - I did not jam, straight-ahead isn't my
thing. There were a handful of jammers waiting for their shot at 10pm;
keys, bass, vocals, drums. There were no horns waiting to jam at the
time I went, but there are horns in the house band so they can read
their book in Bb I suppose. This session is not as scary as it sounds
from the description. The jammers did not seem&nbsp;to be pro cats or
anything like that. In fact this would be a rather ideal session for
someone getting their feet wet. (When singers are allowed to read their
lyrics on the stage, that should tell you a lot.) The session was
scheduled for 7-10pm, more-or-less, the timings not being real strict.
This club is very nice on the inside, although the neighborhood is
_very_ sketchy. You may get lucky and find street parking if you arrive
before 10pm. Excellent pakistani take-out across the street, open late.
(Updated July 2011 by SJ)<br><br><h2>Amnesia</h2>When: Wednesday evenings jazz session 10pm<br><br>Where: <a href="http://amnesiathebar.com">Amnesia</a>, 853 Valencia St. Between 19th &amp; 20th, SF 415.970.0012<br><br>Host: Mike Abraham <br><br>Happens
every Wednesday at 10.&nbsp; Mike plays one set with the house
band.&nbsp; The players are very good mostly.&nbsp; Jazz, lots of horn
players show up. 21 and over, beer and wine.&nbsp; Parking, well, it's San Francisco. &nbsp;(updated Sep 2011 by DR)<br><br><h2>Jack's Club</h2>When: Sunday blues jam &nbsp;5-9pm<br><br>Where: <a href="http://jacksclubsf.com">Jack's Club</a>, 2545 24th St @ Utah, SF &nbsp;415.641.5371<br><br>Host: Thunder Blue<br><br>Finally,
