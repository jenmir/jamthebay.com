<p><img style="width: 336px; height: 420px;" src="images/keywork_sm.jpg" alt="keywork" class="imageleft">Welcome to Jam The Bay - the consolidated
and collected info for jam sessions and jammers throughout the SF Bay
Area.</p>
<p>This
site content has been up and down under different names for some years.
Meanwhile the same information and pointers were available in other
formats&nbsp;via email lists, listservs,&nbsp;private
conversations,
and a disparate network of plugged-in musicians that were somehow
always&nbsp;dialed in to the local music scene.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, Jam The Bay endeavors to pull all this information
together into
a single location, making it easier for newcomers, travelers,
returners, late-bloomers, revivalists, and people just
plain-ol'&nbsp;passin' through that are wanting the hook up and
wanting
to play great
music with others in an extremely casual setting. Jam The Bay provides
all this - and provides it <span style="font-weight: bold;">without</span>
the overhead and hassles of joining an email list, or compromising your
privacy, or
signing up for yet another account on yet another dubious and possibly
short-lived web service,&nbsp; or time-consuming "research" that is
often needed.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What exactly is a "jam session" anyway?</h2>
<p>The "jam sesh" for short has a long and glorious history in
music. Blues musicians were at the forefront of this format,
with jazz musicians following behind closely. Players in other genres
have come to accept the format too, drawing their own lists of
"standards" and material that&nbsp;pretty much lots of casual
players
know. Their instrumentation runs the gamut from guitars, bass, drums,
chick singers, "blues harp", and the occasion horn player.
Jazz-formatted sessions have become particularly useful for horn
players.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>I'm not ready to play with a band yet.&nbsp;</h2>
That's
okay, because a session isn't really a&nbsp;band in the sense that
you
have to commit to regular rehearsals, put up with difficult
personalities and iffy behavior from others. A session is a commitment,
but for one night only! You show up, you sign up (for open
sessions), and if you're reasonably well-prepared you play a few songs,
take your bows, and that's it! <br>
<h2>Play with complete strangers? &nbsp;Why would I do this??</h2>
<p> Different players will tell you different things, but all
sessions provide a few key things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Providing essential networking for musicians, especially
those new to the community</li>
<li>Providing performance opportunities for
intermediate/advanced players who can't commit full-time to a band
right now</li>
<li>Allowing
established players to hear other players and consider them
for&nbsp;subs, guest players and often, permanent positions in
their
band</li>
<li>Providing a casual format to try out a new song, a new
style of music, or a new instrument</li>
<li>Building confidence in beginning players with their stage
presence and delivery</li>
<li>Providing traffic to session-hosting venues on off-nights
during the week, when things are generally slow.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2>So... I'm ready!&nbsp; How do I get started?</h2>
