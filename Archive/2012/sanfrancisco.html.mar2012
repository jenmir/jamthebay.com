<h2>Bayview Boat Club</h2>
When: Third Thursday monthly&nbsp;blues jam<br>
<br>
Where: <a href="http://bayviewboatclub.org/events.html">The
Bayview Boat Club</a>
, 489 Terry Francois Blvd., SF - 415.495.9500<br>
<br>
Host: Mike Dingle<br>
<br>
Acoustic players start at around 9, then around 10 or so, things start
to get electric. Jammers should sign in as guests of Mike at the door.
This is one of the quirkiest venues in San Francisco. Don't miss this
one!! (Updated June 2009 by RD)<br>
<br>
I've been to this jam a few times and I can vouch that it is *very*
horn-friendly ! (Updated Oct 2009 by SJ)<br><br>Jam is still going. Awesome players continue to materialize. (Updated Aug 2011 by RD)<br><br>
<h2>Velma's</h2>
When: Monday blues jam<br>
<br>
Where: Velma's, 2246 Jerrold Avenue, SF&nbsp; 415.824.7646
<br>
<br>Velmas has shuttered. SF looking grim these days. (Updated Aug 2011 by RD)<br>
<br>
<h2>Skip's Tavern</h2>
<p> When: Various nights, depending on genre</p>
<p>Where: <a href="http://skipstavern.com">Skip's
Tavern,</a> 458 Cortland Ave, SF 415.282.3456</p>
<p>Host: Depends on night</p>This jam died when Skips changed owners. I
stopped by recently. Skip's reopened but old-timers should brace
themselves for a shock. The "new" Skip's contains absolutely no traces
whatsoever of the old one. All pics - memorabilia - memories gone, and
only the horseshoe bar and pool table remain. Chilling is the best
description I can think of (with barren and soulless the runners-up).
The updated format will thoroughly appeal to the hipsters and yuppies
and sundry that have discovered Bernal in recent years. The new owner
has applied for an entertainment permit, but based on what I saw, I do
not expect the jam to ever return.&nbsp; (Updated July 2011 by SJ)<br><br>
<h2>Grant and Green</h2>
When: Monday nights jazz session<br>
<br>
Where: Grant and Green, 1371 Grant Ave, SF &nbsp;415.693.9565<br>
<br>
Host: Mike Olmos<br>
<br>
This jazz session has been going for a while but we have no idea what they're
reading/doing. Send a review! <br><br><h2>50 Mason Social House&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>When: Sunday evenings pro jazz session 7-10pm<br><br>Where: 50 Mason St, San Francisco&nbsp; (near Market)<br><br>Host: Peter Eden<br><br>A fairly new reading session for SF - we would appreciate a review. See <a href="http://jazzjamsf.com">JazzJamSF.com</a> for details and a link to their updated Facebook page for the session. &nbsp;From the host: <br><br>"Here are some guidelines that will make it easy and fun for you to participate in the jam:<br>- Must be 21 or older. 50 Mason serves beer and wine.<br>- Sign-up to play. That's the big one. If you don't sign up, you may lose your opportunity.<br>- Decide on what tune(s) you would like to play _before_ coming to the stage.<br>-
Singers should be able to sing with a band, know their keys, know their
tunes, and bring charts, not sheet music (at least 3 copies), in the
key they sing the tune in. <br>- House provides PA, ,microphone,
electronic piano (88 weighted keys). Bring sticks if you're playing
drums. Electric Bass players should bring their instrument; acoustic
players can use our bassist's instrument. Guitarists should bring a
small amp with their guitar. Horns - you're on your own!<br>- Our Facebook and web pages have a suggested tunes list."<br><br><br>Stopped
by recently as an observer - I did not jam, straight-ahead isn't my
thing. There were a handful of jammers waiting for their shot at 10pm;
keys, bass, vocals, drums. There were no horns waiting to jam at the
time I went, but there are horns in the house band so they can read
their book in Bb I suppose. This session is not as scary as it sounds
from the description. The jammers did not seem&nbsp;to be pro cats or
anything like that. In fact this would be a rather ideal session for
someone getting their feet wet. (When singers are allowed to read their
lyrics on the stage, that should tell you a lot.) The session was
scheduled for 7-10pm, more-or-less, the timings not being real strict.
This club is very nice on the inside, although the neighborhood is
_very_ sketchy. You may get lucky and find street parking if you arrive
before 10pm. Excellent pakistani take-out across the street, open late.
(Updated July 2011 by SJ)<br><br><h2>Amnesia</h2>When: Wednesday evenings 10pm<br><br>Where: <a href="http://amnesiathebar.com">Amnesia</a>, 853 Valencia St. Between 19th &amp; 20th, SF 415.970.0012<br><br>Host: Mike Abraham <br><br>Happens
every Wednesday at 10.&nbsp; Mike plays one set with the house
band.&nbsp; The players are very good mostly.&nbsp; Jazz, lots of horn
players show up. 21 and over, beer and wine.&nbsp; Parking, well, it's San Francisco. &nbsp;(updated Sep 2011 by DR)<br><br><br><h2>Russia House</h2>When: Wednesday evenings 8pm<br><br>Where: Russia House, 2011 Bayshore Blvd &nbsp;415.330.9991<br><br>This jam is&nbsp;dead. (Updated May 2011 by FW)<br><br><br><br>
