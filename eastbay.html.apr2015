<br>
Host: Varies<br>
<br>Jam is still going, but with a different format. &nbsp;Jeanie at
Vinnie's got tired of the blues so the jam there is now only heavy
metal. (Updated Jun 2014 by SG)<br><br><br><h2>The Bistro, Hayward</h2>When: First Sunday Monthly jazz session, 4pm<br>When: Second and Fourth Sundays blues sessions, 4pm<br>When: First Wednesday Monthly jazz session, 9pm,<br><br>Where: <a href="http://www.the-bistro.com">The Bistro</a>, 1001 B Street, Hayward &nbsp;510.886.8525<br><br>Hayward's best-known live music venue has two different sessions. Send a review!<br><br>(From the Wednesday session host Poh Teng:)<br>The
house band starts at 9pm. We take a break and open up the session.
Anyone who wants to play should come talk to us during the break. Our
usual crowd of players who walk in are Berkeley Jazz School, CSUEB
students and alumni and a lot of pro players in the area. We have had
guests come from outof town to sit in as well.

$3 cover is still in force on Monday nites. There are some YouTube
videos from recent Monday nite Blues Jams at Armando's. (Updated Jul
2012 by TD)<br><br><br><h2>Marina Lounge, San Leandro</h2>When: Thursday evenings 9pm<br><br>Where:&nbsp;Marina Lounge, 13880 Catalina St., SL &nbsp; 510.483.8622<br><br>Host: Varies<br><br>Jam is ongoing. Open to varied genres - blues, rock, soul. Signup board for instruments &nbsp;before 9pm. No cover. <br><br><br>It
could stand to have a little more structure as dominant personalities
can monopolize the scene. There are different skill levels, with most
performers having had substantial live performance experience. Friendly
bunch, conversational and generally welcoming. It was funny last week
with 5-6 bassists showing up. This there was a substitute MC that was
so-so. A frontman took the mic early and overshared. I noticed every
week the volume levels are briefly suppressed so that a flutist can put
in her contributions. &nbsp;I heard about the session from a friend who
sings and plays blues harp. It's a bit of local color. Location is
industrial part of San Leandro that is safe, with easy parking.
