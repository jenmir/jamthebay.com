Bart Shea's jam at 
<a href="http://murfsbroadwaycocktaillounge.com/Calendar.html"> 
The Broadway Lounge</a> in Redwood City is a really good one.  Festivities start at about 6:00 PM. and run through 10:00, or so, every Sunday.  Bart does a great job of putting together different groups of players for the house band, every week.  (Updated June 2009 by RD)

Don't forget
Mike Dingle's Third Thursday jam at <a href="http://bayviewboatclub.org/events.html"> The Bayview Boat Club!</a>  Acoustic players start at around 9, then around 10 or so, things start to get electric.  Jammers should sign in as guests of Mike at the door. This is one of the quirkiest venues in San Francisco.   Don't miss this one!! (Updated June 2009 by RD)

Billy Dunn hosts a great jam, every Monday Night, at <a href="http://sausalitocruisingclub.org/"> The Sausalito Cruising.</a>  The house band is excellent and the jammers include some of Marin's finest players. The band starts at  6:00, and the jams starts around 8:00.  There's a $15 Cover Charge,  but that includes a buffet dinner. (Updated June 2009 by RD)

Ed Ivey's Monday night jam at Velma's in San Francisco keeps getting better and better.   The house band starts at around 7:30 and Ed Starts working jammers in, shortly thereafter.  Velma's is an undiscovered San Francisco Treasure.  It's a great room and some very talented musicians come out to play.   Sometimes, to Velma's delight, there are 4 or 5 horns playing together.  There is no cover charge... and free food.  Last week, the chicken was excellent. (Updated June 2009 by RD) <br> Velma's : 2246 Jerrold Avenue, San Francisco., 415.824.7646

When I'm in the South Bay on Friday nights,  I try to catch the jam (10.00pm) at Woodham's in Santa Clara.  Some great guitar players hang out there, and occasionally there are some good horn players. (Updated June 2009 by RD)
