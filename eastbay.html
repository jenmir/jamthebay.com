<br>Jam is still going, but with a different format. &nbsp;Jeanie at

Send a review!<br><br>(From the Wednesday session host Poh Teng:)<br>The
house band starts at 9pm. We take a break and open up the session.
Anyone who wants to play should come talk to us during the break. Our
usual crowd of players who walk in are Berkeley Jazz School, CSUEB
students and alumni and a lot of pro players in the area. We have had
guests come from out of town to sit in as well. (Updated Apr 2012)<br><br>

<br><h2>Ivy Room, Albany</h2>When: Tuesday evenings &nbsp;9pm-12:30am<br><br>Where: <a href="http://ivyroom.com/">Ivy Room</a>, 860 San Pablo Ave, Albany &nbsp;510.526.5888 <br>
  <br>Host: Mike Toth<br><br>New session as of Jan 2016, with <a href="http://facebook.com/ivyroomjam/">Facebook Link</a> here. 
No signups, no slots, fluid situations. Full backline including guitar amps.
Song selections tend toward funk, classic soul and jazz of the non-reading and horn-friendly sort; expect to see horn players every session.
As with all new sessions, recommend messaging host on FB to confirm the jam is still on. Send a review!

<br><h2>Marina Lounge, San Leandro</h2>When: Thursday evenings 9pm<br><br>Where:&nbsp;Marina Lounge, 13880 Catalina St., SL &nbsp; 510.483.8622<br><br>Host: Varies<br><br>Jam is ongoing. Open to varied genres - blues, rock, soul. Signup board for instruments &nbsp;before 9pm. No cover. <br><br><br>It
could stand to have a little more structure as dominant personalities
can monopolize the scene. There are different skill levels, with most
performers having had substantial live performance experience. Friendly
bunch, conversational and generally welcoming. It was funny last week
with 5-6 bassists showing up. There was a substitute MC that was
so-so. A frontman took the mic early and overshared. I noticed every
week the volume levels are briefly suppressed so that a flutist can put
in her contributions. &nbsp;I heard about the session from a friend who
sings and plays blues harp. It's a bit of local color. Location is
industrial part of San Leandro that is safe, with easy parking.

<br>It's baaaaaaaack..... The legendary Mojo session is back on as of February

is a terrible jam. I've gone to this jam a few times and they have a
list that's thrown away if any of the hosts friends show up, which is
often. If you go a few times, you will notice there are few regulars in
terms of the musicians who show up.&nbsp; There's a reason for
that.&nbsp; If you're a glutton for rude hosts and favoritism, then by
all means this jam is for you. (Updated May 2015 by JH)<br><br>
