is a terrible jam. I've gone to this jam a few times and they have a
list that's thrown away if any of the hosts friends show up, which is
often. If you go a few times, you will notice there are few regulars in
terms of the musicians who show up.&nbsp; There's a reason for
that.&nbsp; If you're a glutton for rude hosts and favoritism, then by
all means this jam is for you. (Updated May 2015 by JH)<br><br>
